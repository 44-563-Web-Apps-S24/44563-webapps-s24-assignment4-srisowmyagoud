        <h1>Sri Sowmya Polampalli â€œdoes
            Chekov tonight"</h1>
            <p>[In PROSOROV'S house. A sitting-room with pillars; behind is seen a
                large dining-room. It is midday, the sun is shining brightly outside. In
                the dining-room the table is being laid for lunch.]
                
                [OLGA, in the regulation blue dress of a teacher at a girl's high
                school, is walking about correcting exercise books; MASHA, in a black
                dress, with a hat on her knees, sits and reads a book; IRINA, in white,
                stands about, with a thoughtful expression.]
                
                OLGA. It's just a year since father died last May the fifth, on your
                name-day, Irina. It was very cold then, and snowing. I thought I would
                never survive it, and you were in a dead faint. And now a year has
                gone by and we are already thinking about it without pain, and you are
                wearing a white dress and your face is happy. [Clock strikes twelve] And
                the clock struck just the same way then. [Pause] I remember that there
                was music at the funeral, and they fired a volley in the cemetery. He
                was a general in command of a brigade but there were few people present.
                Of course, it was raining then, raining hard, and snowing.
                
                IRINA. Why think about it!
                
                [BARON TUZENBACH, CHEBUTIKIN and SOLENI appear by the table in the
                dining-room, behind the pillars.]
                
                OLGA. It's so warm to-day that we can keep the windows open, though the
                birches are not yet in flower. Father was put in command of a brigade,
                and he rode out of Moscow with us eleven years ago. I remember perfectly
                that it was early in May and that everything in Moscow was flowering
                then. It was warm too, everything was bathed in sunshine. Eleven years
                have gone, and I remember everything as if we rode out only yesterday.
                Oh, God! When I awoke this morning and saw all the light and the spring,
                joy entered my heart, and I longed passionately to go home.
                
                CHEBUTIKIN. Will you take a bet on it?
                
                TUZENBACH. Oh, nonsense.
                
                [MASHA, lost in a reverie over her book, whistles softly.]
                
                OLGA. Don't whistle, Masha. How can you! [Pause] I'm always having
                headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach
                till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old
                woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working
                here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have
                been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and
                gains in strength...
                
                IRINA. To go away to Moscow. To sell the house, drop everything here,
                and go to Moscow...</p>
