            <h6>THE THREE SISTERS Anton Chekov</h6>
            <p class="Direction">[In PROSOROV'S house. A sitting-room with pillars; behind is seen a
                large dining-room. It is midday, the sun is shining brightly outside. In
                the dining-room the table is being laid for lunch.]</p>
                
            <p class="Direction">[OLGA, in the regulation blue dress of a teacher at a girl's high
                school, is walking about correcting exercise books; MASHA, in a black
                dress, with a hat on her knees, sits and reads a book; IRINA, in white,
                stands about, with a thoughtful expression.]</p>
                
            <h5 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h5> 
            <p class="Speech">It's just a year since father died last May the fifth, on your
                name-day,</p> 
            <h5 class="Irina">Irina.</h5> 
            <p class="Speech">It was very cold then, and snowing. I thought I would
                never survive it, and you were in a dead faint. And now a year has
                gone by and we are already thinking about it without pain, and you are
                wearing a white dress and your face is happy.</p> 
            <p class="Direction">[Clock strikes twelve]</p>
            <p class="Speech">And the clock struck just the same way then. [Pause] I remember that there
            was music at the funeral, and they fired a volley in the cemetery. He
            was a general in command of a brigade but there were few people present.
            Of course, it was raining then, raining hard, and snowing.</p>
                
            <h5 class="IRINA">IRINA.</h5>
            <p class="Speech" >Why think about it!</p>
                
            <p class="Direction">[BARON TUZENBACH, CHEBUTIKIN and SOLENI appear by the table in the
                dining-room, behind the pillars.]</p>
            <h5 class="OLGA">OLGA.</h5> 
            <p class="Speech">It's so warm to-day that we can keep the windows open, though the
                birches are not yet in flower. Father was put in command of a brigade,
                and he rode out of Moscow with us eleven years ago. I remember perfectly
                that it was early in May and that everything in Moscow was flowering
                then. It was warm too, everything was bathed in sunshine. Eleven years
                have gone, and I remember everything as if we rode out only yesterday.
                Oh, God! When I awoke this morning and saw all the light and the spring,
                joy entered my heart, and I longed passionately to go home.</p>

            <p class="Speech" > Oh, nonsense.</p>
                
            <p class="Direction">[MASHA, lost in a reverie over her book, whistles softly.]</p>
                
            <h5 class="OLGA" >OLGA.</h5>
            <p class="Speech" >Don't whistle, Masha. How can you! [Pause] I'm always having
                headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach
                till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old
                woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working
                here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have
                been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and
                gains in strength...</p>
